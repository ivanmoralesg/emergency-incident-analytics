Initial Questions on Requirements

- What does incident data look like? see JSON samples
- Display location and data (what data?) geohash, latitude/longitude, address, intersection, response zone
- Enrich how? add weather (temperature, rain, snow, etc.) see available relevant data in Meteostat
- Stakeholders: fire departments, community, victims, local governments


Discovery

- Inspect sample JSON in data folder. Interesting groups:
  - Address, common place name, geohash, longitude/latitude, response_zone
  - Aparatus are vehicles customized for firefighting: fire engine (truck), aerial, water tender, hazmat, heavy rescue
    unit_type, unit_status (sequence of events), station,  
  - Description: main incident data
  - Fire department
- Inspect Meteostat weather data, find common id/key to join incident with weather data
  - Hourly data by lat/lon, start/end date -> hourly data with:
  - Temperature, rain precipitation, snow precipitation, wind speed


Stack

- React
- google-map-react component https://github.com/google-map-react/google-map-react
- Google Maps


Data APIs:
- Weather data from https://dev.meteostat.net/
- Maps from Google Maps


Design

- Join incident and weather data with getWeather function
- Inputs to getWeather: latitude, longitude, startTime, endTime, eventId)
- Output: 
  { 
    eventId: 123,
    temperatureRange: 80 F - 85 F,
    rain: yes/no,
    snow: yes/no, 
    maxWindSpeed: 8,
  } 
- Determine zoom level for map component, derived lat/long min/max?
- Round down startTime to startDate, round up endTime to endDate
- Components:
  <App>   
    <IncidentMap>
      Holds state
      Calculates lat/long, zoom level for map
      Creates incidents array of: { eventId, name, startTime, endTime, weather (from getWeather(eventId), location { name } }
      Iterates and Passes individual incident prop to <Incident> components 
    <GoogleMapReact>
    <Incident>
    <Incident> renders as HTML:
      Name
      Temperature: temperatureRange
      Rain: yes/no
      Snow: yes/no
      Wind Speed (max): 8
      Started at: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss

- Store API keys outside of Git repo, e.g. ~/api-keys/meteostat
